# Explore VR android application

Explore is a virtual reality experience for who love to travel and explore new places but has no enough time and money to do that.
it describes the different types of life (wild & sea & space) virtually through Google cardboard.
it has a great impact to support tourism in Egypt and help people to explore the most beautiful places in the world, discover the space and enjoy watching 360 short movies.
Life became as small as cardboard glass!
